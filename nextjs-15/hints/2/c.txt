We can use useActionState !!

const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createProduct,{errors:{}});

Now createProduct should receive two arguments, prevState and formData.

Based on the values returned in state from createProduct server function, we can update the UI.

Bonus question: Can we also retain the values in the form along with showing error message on UI incase there is a validation error ?
