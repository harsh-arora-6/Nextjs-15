Exercise 4a

Now similar to editProduct we need to implement removeProduct for removing a product.

1. Go to /exercise/products-db
2. Create a removeProduct server function in /exercise/actions, which accepts id of product and calls deleteProduct of prisma-db file.
3. Can we wrap the delete button in a form and pass removeProduct to it, similar to editProduct ?
