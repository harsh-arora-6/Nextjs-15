Exercise 2c

Now we want to validate the user's input before adding product it in db.

Do this by using getErrors function (present in '@/helpers') or some other validation as you like, inside the createProduct
server function we have created, to validate title, description and price of the product. 
Now incase of errors we don't want to add product to db and instead we want to somehow update the UI based on those errors.

Which is the hook which returns the response from server function ?
