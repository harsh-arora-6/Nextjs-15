Exercise 3

1. Go to /exercise/products-db/[id]/page.jsx, a form same as creation form has been added there.
2. We need to prefill the form fields with the values of product which we are editing. (Can we fetch the product using its id ? How can we get the id ?)
3. We need to create an editProduct server function similar to createProduct which would update product instead of adding product to db.
   For editing we would be needing the id of the product also. How can we pass the id to the editProduct server function ?
