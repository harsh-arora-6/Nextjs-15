Exercise 5

Now coming to the cherry-on-top part of server functions in form.
We get progressive enhancement: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement

Basically user is able to submit the form, while js is loading or is disabled.

To test this:

1. Go to /exercise/create-product-server/page.jsx
2. useActionState takes a third argument which is the permalink. Just add '/exercise/product-submission' string as third argument.
Here, we are saying that we want to go to /exercise/product-submission route when js is loading or is disabled and the form is submitted by the user.
Check the code for /exercise/product-submission also.
3. Run yarn build and yarn start
4. Go to browser, in sources tab press 'cmd + p' and type disable javascript.
5. After disabling, go to /exercise/create-product-server route.
6. Submit the form and boom it gets submitted without js!!. Check /exercise/products-db route to verify successful addition of new product to db.
